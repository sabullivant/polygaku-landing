            Approximately 7 years ago while attending university (for an unrelated major), I began serious Japanese study - we’re talking hours each day put aside specifically for studying. I had a lot of free time and it was mostly spent on two things: Learning Japanese and enjoying Japanese. I did this for about 2 years before getting to the “I’m too comfortable with what I know so I’m no longer going to study” stage - more on that in a different post. In 2018 I passed the JLPT N1.
What’s your reason for learning a new language? I can think of a few off the top of my head:
Communicate with loved ones, family, friends, or a partner 
You love films in that language 
You love TV shows in that language 
You love Music in that language 
You love the country that language is spoken in 
Whatever it is, it’s probably because you love something enough to put in the time and effort to learn it. In my case I love Japanese comedy (お笑い) - it’s a bit of an odd one, not the typical anime or j-drama. Japan has such a sense of comedy that sits so well with me and “strikes a cord”. I think the Japanese comedy style is some of the most hilarious standup and banter-comedy I’ve ever seen and to this day I enjoy watching endless hours of it. This brings me to my first note:
Language learning is very difficult if you don’t enjoy it
I have tried and failed at learning other languages, that I in theory have an interest in but don’t have anything in particular that draws me to it - French is beautiful, Korean has incredible films to enjoy, and Mandarin could possibly be the most useful language in the world to learn. However, without a passion to pursue the language, my studies all fell short and fizzled out.
Japanese was different, I was able to come home and excitedly begin studying, throw hours into the study and vocabulary reviews, and was quickly able to establish a strong foundation. What’s more, is I enjoyed it more and more as I got to see the fruits of my labour in understanding the comedy and tv-shows I watched.
Take note of those who live in foreign countries and have so for 10+ years and have never really grasped the language - perhaps you’ve been transferred to a foreign branch of your company - learning the language becomes a requirement for work and thus is very difficult to pursue when there is no passion.
If you’re serious about learning a new language, find a passion within that language. This alone will become one of the biggest factors in determining your success.
Language learning can be a lot easier than you think if you DO enjoy it
For English speakers, Japanese is among one of the most difficult languages in the world to learn, alongside Mandarin for being fundamentally so different from English.
I agree Japanese is very different from English, but I don’t think that is what makes it difficult. I think the “difficulty” that people find in learning Japanese is not inherent of the language but in the method of learning it. It’s a common process:
Determination to learn a language 
Purchase beginner books and a notepad 
Read beginner books and take notes 
Progress slowly 
Look at other methods and resources 
Spend more $ trying new methods 
Progress slowly 
Lose motivation, potentially stop studying 
I went through that as well, initially. I always wondered “what if”: What if there is a more effective study method and I could be learning quicker? What if there is a “magic bullet” that happens to work so well with me I skyrocket in Japanese ability? What if I purchase this course maybe then I’ll make more progress.
It’s a trap and is probably the biggest time-sink trap you can fall into. THIS is difficult, this is what makes learning a new language difficult - a lack of focus. A lack of direction. Once you have a method and direction, if you follow it you will see results, and I believe a lot faster than you think (or people expect).
What to do?
Here’s my recommendation, and what I did every day while studying. I think this is the most effective way of learning a language, or anything for that matter. Along with enjoying your passion in the language you’re learning, this will provide the fastest and best results and you’ll notice improvements.
Purchase a single beginners book or course (or use a free course online) 
This will be the basis of your language foundation - an introduction to the language, your first words, basic grammar - everything you need to get familiar with using and speaking your language. It can be paid, or free - whatever you find - just stick to one and only one.
I'm publishing a course built in Notion
Download or create a Flashcard system 
Flashcards are an incredible way to commit lots of new information to long term memory and I used flashcards to great effect. I suggest downloading a digital flashcard app, known as an SRS (Spaced Repetition Software/System).
SRS apps are a digital version of flashcards, the word or grammar you’re learning on the front - you take some time to remember it, then view the back of the card to see the answer - if you got it right then mark it as correct if you got it wrong then mark it as incorrect. The SRS will automatically schedule cards you get wrong to appear more frequently, and cards you get consistently correct to appear less frequently. There are many, I recommend Anki - it’s free: https://apps.ankiweb.net/
Over time the increased repetition is very effective at committing what you’re learning to long time memory. It’s easy to use, just show up and start reviewing. When you’re done you’re done.
Put them together 
Work through your beginner’s book or course as normal - however as you go make written notes of new vocabulary and grammar. At the end of each study session, whether it’s 5 minutes long or 2 hours long - create flashcards out of your notes for each vocabulary or grammar. Once you’ve created the cards review them, close the app and finish your study for the day.
Next study session, begin by reviewing any cards that are due in your SRS, and then jump back into your book or course and continue studying.
Allocate time to enjoy the things you love 
For me it meant after each study session, I would watch an hour of Comedy shows or standup. You immediately notice new words you’ve learned, it’s almost like you’re decrypting the language as you learn it - and it’s incredibly satisfying. You start to understand more, and enjoy more - so you’re more motivated to study - you study harder and understand more, and enjoy more… and it goes on and on.

I’ve met and talked to enough people who get affected by the opinion that ### language is too difficult, or one of the most difficult languages to learn so it must be so hard to do - and they get dissuaded from putting in the time to learn it.
Or those who jump from resource to resource trying to find a magic bullet but instead waste a lot of time searching rather than learning.
I hope this brief breakdown of language learning from someone who has been through it (and is still in it) helps share some motivation to those people and helps to narrow their focus and show them direction.
